deprecations:

  - The tool neutron-debug is now deprecated, to be replaced with a new
    set of troubleshooting and diagnostic tools. There is no plan for
    removal in the immediate term, and not until comparable tools will be
    adequate enough to supplant neutron-debug altogether. For more information,
    please see https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/troubleshooting
