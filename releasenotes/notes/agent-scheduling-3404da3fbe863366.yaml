    In Liberty, some changes were made to agent scheduling to enable a more
    flexible agent scheduling configuration.
features:
  - Neutron now provides a way for admins to manually schedule agents, allowing
    host resources to be tested before they are enabled for tenant use.
other:
  - Please read the `enabling new agents specification
    <https://github.com/openstack/neutron-specs/blob/master/specs/liberty/enable-new-agents.rst>`_
    for more information on how to manually schedule agents.
