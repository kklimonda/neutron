features:
  - A new mechanism has been added to the ``neutron-netns-cleanup`` tool that
    allows to kill processes listening on any ``Unix`` or network socket within
    a namespace. The new mechanism will try to kill those processes gracefully
    using the ``SIGTERM`` signal and, if they refuse to die, then the
    ``SIGKILL`` signal will be sent to each remaining process to ensure a
    proper cleanup.
