features:
  - A new mechanism has been added to netns_cleanup to
    kill processes that are listening on any port/unix
    socket within the namespace. This will try to kill
    them gracefully via SIGTERM and, if they don't die,
    then a SIGKILL will be sent to the remaining
    processes to ensure a proper cleanup.
