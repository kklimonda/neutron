features:
  - |
    Allow to configure ``router`` service plugin without ``dvr`` API extension
    loaded and exposed. To achieve that, set the new ``enable_dvr`` option to
    ``False`` in ``neutron.conf`` file.
upgrade:
  - |
    Consider setting ``enable_dvr`` to ``False`` in ``neutron.conf`` file if
    your setup doesn't support DVR. This will make Neutron stop advertising
    support for the ``dvr`` API extension via its ``/v2.0/extensions`` API
    endpoint.
