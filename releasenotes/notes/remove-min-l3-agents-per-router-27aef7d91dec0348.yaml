upgrade:
  - The ``min_l3_agents_per_router`` configuration option was
    deprecated in Newton cycle and removed in Ocata. HA routers
    no longer require a minimal number of L3 agents to
    be created, although obviously they require at least
    two L3 agents to provide HA guarantees. The rationale for the
    removal of the option is the case a router was created
    just when an agent was not operational. The creation
    of the router will now succeed, and when a second agent
    resumes operation the router will be scheduled to it
    providing HA.
