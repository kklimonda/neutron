    IPv6 addresses in DHCP namespaces will now be
    (correctly) statically configured by the DHCP agent.
fixes:
  - There is a race condition when adding ports in
    DHCP namespaces where an IPv6 address could be
    dynamically created via SLAAC from a Router
    Advertisement sent from the L3 agent, leading to
    a failure to start the DHCP agent. This bug has
    been fixed, but care must be taken on an upgrade
    dealing with any possibly stale dynamic addresses.
    For more information, see bug
    `1627902 <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1627902>`_.
upgrade:
  - On upgrade, IPv6 addresses in the DHCP namespaces
    that have been created dynmically via SLAAC will be
    removed, and a static IPv6 address will be added
    instead.
