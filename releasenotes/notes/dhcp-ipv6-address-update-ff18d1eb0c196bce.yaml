fixes:
  - There is a race condition when adding ports in DHCP namespaces where an
    IPv6 address could be dynamically created via SLAAC from a Router
    Advertisement sent from the L3 agent, leading to a failure to start the
    DHCP agent. This bug has been fixed, but care must be taken on an upgrade
    dealing with any potentially stale dynamic addresses.  For more
    information, see bug `1627902 <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1627902>`_.
upgrade:
  - On upgrade, IPv6 addresses in DHCP namespaces that have been created
    dynamically via SLAAC will be removed, and static IPv6 addresses will be
    added instead.
