prelude: >
    Enable creation of VXLANs with different multicast
    addresses allocated by VNI-address mappings.
features:
  - The ability to control vni-multicast address
    distribution in linuxbridge agent via new config
    option - multicast_ranges.
other:
  - Example configuration of `multicast_ranges` in
    ml2_conf.ini under the `[vxlan]` config. section
    multicast_ranges = 224.0.0.10:10:90,225.0.0.15:100:900
    For VNI between 10 and 90, the multicast address
    224.0.0.0.10 will be used, and for 100 through 900
    225.0.0.15 will be used. Other VNI values will get
    standard `vxlan_group` address. For more info see RFE
