features:
  - The ``created_at`` and ``updated_at`` resource fields now include a
    timezone indicator at the end.  Because this is a change in field format,
    the old ``timestamp_core`` extension has been removed and replaced with a
    ``standard-attr-timestamp`` extension.
upgrade:
  - The ``timestamp_core`` extension has been removed and replaced with the
    ``standard-attr-timestamp`` extension. Resources will still have timestamps
    in the ``created_at`` and ``updated_at`` fields, but timestamps will have
    time zone info appended to the end to be consistent with other OpenStack
    projects.
