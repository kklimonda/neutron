  - The created_at and updated_at fields available on Neutron
    resources now include a timezone indicator at the end.
    Because this is a change in format, the old 'timestamp_core'
    extension has been removed and replaced with a 'timestamp'
    extension.
upgrade:
  - The 'timestamp_core' extension has been removed and replaced
    with the 'standard-attr-timestamp' extension. Objects will still
    have timestamps in the 'created_at' and 'updated_at' fields, but
    they will have the timestamp appended to the end of them
    to be consistent with other OpenStack projects.
fixes:
  - Bug 1561200 has been fixed by including the timezone with
    Neutron 'created_at' and 'updated_at' fields.
