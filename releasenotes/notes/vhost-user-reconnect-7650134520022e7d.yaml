features:
  - vhost-user reconnect is a mechanism  which allows a vhost-user frontend to
    reconnect to a vhost-user backend in the event the backend terminates
    either as a result of a graceful shutdown or a crash.  This allows a VM
    utilising a vhost-user interface to reconnect automatically to the backend
    e.g.  Open vSwitch without requiring the VM to reboot.  In this release,
    support was added to the neutron Open vSwitch agent and ``ml2`` driver for
    vhost-user reconnect.
other:
  - vhost-user reconnect requires dpdk 16.07 and qemu 2.7 and openvswitch 2.6
    to function. if an older qemu is used, reconnect will not be available but
    vhost-user will still function.
