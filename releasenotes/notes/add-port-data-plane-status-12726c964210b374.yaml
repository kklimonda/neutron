features:
  - Add ``data_plane_status`` attribute to port resources to represent the
    status of the underlying data plane. This attribute is to be managed
    by entities outside of the Networking service,
    while the ``status`` attribute is managed by the Networking service.
    Both status attributes are independent from one another.
    Third parties can report via Neutron API issues in the underlying data
    plane affecting connectivity from/to Neutron ports.
    Attribute can take values ``None`` (default), ``ACTIVE`` or ``DOWN``,
    and is readable by users and writable by admins and users granted the
    ``data-plane-integrator`` role.
    Append ``data_plane_status`` to ``[ml2] extension_drivers`` config
    option to load the extension driver.
