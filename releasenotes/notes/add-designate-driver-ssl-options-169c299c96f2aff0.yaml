    of neutron for SSL based connections. This makes
    it possible to use neutron with designate in scenario
    where endpoints are SSL based. Users can specify to
    skip cert validation or specify path to a valid cert
    in [designate] section of neutron.conf file.
features:
  - Two new options are added to `[designate]` section to
    support SSL.
  - First option `insecure` allows to skip SSL validation
    when creating a keystone session to initate a designate client.
    Default value is False, which means to always verify connection.
  - Second option `ca_cert` allows setting path to a valid cert file.
    Default is None.
