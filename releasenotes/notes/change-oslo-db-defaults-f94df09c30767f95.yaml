    Previously, ``neutron-server`` was using configuration values
    for ``oslo.db`` that were different from library defaults. Specifically, it
    used the following values when they were not overridden in configuration
    files: ``max_pool_size`` = 10, ``max_overflow`` = 20, ``pool_timeout`` =
    10. In this release, ``neutron-server`` instead relies on default values
    defined by the library itself. If you rely on old default values, you may
    need to adjust your configuration files to explicitly set the new values.
