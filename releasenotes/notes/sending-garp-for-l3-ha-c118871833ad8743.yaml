issues:
  - In kernels < 3.19 net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind was not
    a per-namespace kernel option. L3 HA sets this option
    to zero to avoid sending gratuitous ARPs for IP addresses
    that were removed while processing. If this happens then
    gratuitous ARPs are going to be sent which might populate
    ARP caches of peer machines with the wrong MAC address.
fixes:
  - Versions of keepalived < 1.2.20 don't send gratuitous ARPs
    when keepalived process receives SIGHUP signal. These
    versions are not packaged in some Linux distributions like
    RHEL, CentOS or Ubuntu Xenial. Not sending gratuitous ARPs
    may lead to peer ARP caches containing wrong information
    about floating IP addresses until the entry is invalidated.
    Neutron now sends gratuitous ARPs for all new IP addresses
    that appear on non-HA interfaces in router namespace which
    simulates behavior of new versions of keepalived.
