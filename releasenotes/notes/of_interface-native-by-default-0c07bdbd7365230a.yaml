    Prior to Newton, the neutron-openvswitch-agent used 'ovs-ofctl'
    of_interface driver by default.  In Newton, 'of_interface'
    defaults to 'native'.  This mostly eliminates spawning ovs-ofctl
    and improves performance a little.
upgrade:
  - To retain the old default for neutron-openvswitch-agent, use
    'of_interface = ovs-ofctl' in the '[ovs]' section of your
    openvswitch agent configuration file.
