  - Due to changes in internal L3 logic, a server crash/backend failure during
    FIP creation may leave dangling ports attached on external networks. These
    ports can be identified by a ``PENDING`` ``device_id`` parameter. While
    those ports can also be removed by admins, the ``neutron-server`` service
    will now also trigger periodic (approximately once in 10 minutes) cleanup
    to address the issue.
