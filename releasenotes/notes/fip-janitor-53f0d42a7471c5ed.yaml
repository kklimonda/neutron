    Due to changes in internal L3 logic, a server
    crash/backend failure during FIP creation may
    leave dangling ports attached on external
    networks. These ports can be identified by a
    'PENDING' device_id. The neutron server will
    attempt a cleanup periodically to address the issue.
other:
  - If a floating IP creation gets interrupted by
    a server crash or backend failure, a port can
    be left behind on the external network. Neutron
    will now automatically clean these up after
    approximately 10 minutes. This time value is not
    configurable.
  - Ports in this state will be visible on the external
    network to admins, and will have a device_id value
    of 'PENDING'. They can also be removed manually by
    an admin if waiting for the periodic job to do it is
    undesired.
