features:
  - Middleware was added to parse the ``X-Forwarded-Proto`` HTTP header or the
    Proxy protocol in order to help Neutron respond with the correct URL
    references when it's put behind a TLS proxy such as ``haproxy``. This adds
    ``http_proxy_to_wsgi`` middleware to the pipeline. This middleware is
    disabled by default, but can be enabled via a configuration option in the
    ``[oslo_middleware]`` group.
upgrade:
  - The ``api-paste.ini`` configuration file for the paste pipeline was updated
    to add the ``http_proxy_to_wsgi`` middleware.
