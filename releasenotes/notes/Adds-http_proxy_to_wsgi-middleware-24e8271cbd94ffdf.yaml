features:
  - Middleware was added to parse the X-Forwarded-Proto HTTP header or the
    Proxy protocol in order to help neutron respond with the correct URL refs
    when it's put behind a TLS proxy (such as HAProxy). This adds
    http_proxy_to_wsgi middleware to the pipeline. This middleware is disabled
    by default, but can be enabled via a configuration option in the
    oslo_middleware group.
upgrade:
  - The api-paste.ini configuration file for the paste pipeline was updated to
    add the http_proxy_to_wsgi middleware.
