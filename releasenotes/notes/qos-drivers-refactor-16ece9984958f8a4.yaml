features:
  - The QoS driver architecture has been refactored to overcome several
    previous limitations, the main one was the coupling of QoS details
    into the mechanism drivers, and the next one was the need of
    configuration knobs to enable each specific notification driver,
    that will be handled automatically from now on.

deprecations:
  - |
    notification_drivers from [qos] section has been deprecated. It will be
    removed in a future release.
