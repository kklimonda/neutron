upgrade:
  - A new option ``ha_keepalived_state_change_server_threads`` has been
    added to configure the number of concurrent threads spawned for
    keepalived server connection requests. Higher values increase the
    CPU load on the agent nodes. The default value is half of the number
    of CPUs present on the node. This allows operators to tune the
    number of threads to suit their environment. With more threads,
    simultaneous requests for multiple HA routers state change can be
    handled faster.
