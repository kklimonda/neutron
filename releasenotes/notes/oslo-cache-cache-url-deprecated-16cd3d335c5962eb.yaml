features:
  - Neutron switched to using oslo.cache library to cache port state in
    metadata agent. With it, more caching backends are now available, including
    Memcached and Mongo. More details in oslo.cache documentation.
deprecations:
  - The cache_url configuration option is deprecated as of Newton, and will be
    removed in Ocata. Please configure metadata cache using [cache] group,
    setting enable = True and configuring your backend.
