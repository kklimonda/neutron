    Certain performance enhancements when deploying Neutron with Ubuntu
    Trusty Tahr were found and should be used. Additionally, utilizing
    the Octavia Neutron-LBaaS driver has some performance considerations
    to be aware of during deployment.
issues:
  - The stock Ubuntu Trusty Tahr kernel (3.13) shows linear performance
    degradation when running "ip netns exec" as the number of namespaces
    increases. In cases where scale is important, a later version kernel
    (e.g. 3.19) should be used. This regression should be fixed in Trusty
    Tahr since 3.13.0-36.63 and later kernel versions. For more information,
    please see `Launchpad bug 1328088.
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1328088>`_
  - Creating Neutron-LBaaS load balancers in environments without hardware
    virtualization may be slow when using the Octavia driver. This is due to
    QEMU using the TCG accelerator instead of the KVM accelerator in
    environments without hardware virtualization available. We recommend
    enabling hardware virtualization on your compute nodes, or enabling nested
    virtualization when using the Octavia driver inside a virtual environment.
    See `this link explaining devstack with nested KVM
    <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/devstack/guides/devstack-with-nested-kvm.html>`_
    for details on setting up nested virtualization for DevStack running inside
    KVM.
