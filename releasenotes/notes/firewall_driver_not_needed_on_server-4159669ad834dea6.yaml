    The Neutron server no longer needs to be configured
    with a firewall driver and it can support mixed
    environments of hybrid iptables firewalls and the
    pure OVS firewall.
features:
  - The Neutron server now learns the appropriate firewall
    wiring behavior from each OVS agent so it no longer needs
    to be configured with the firewall_driver. This means
    it also supports multiple agents with different types
    of firewalls.
