fixes:
  - In order to fix the communication issues between
    SR-IOV instances and regular instances
    the FDB population extension is added to the
    OVS or linuxbridge agent.
    the cause was that messages from SR-IOV direct port
    instance to normal port instances located on
    the same hypervisor were sent directly to the wire
    because the FDB table was not yet updated.
    FDB population extension tracks instances
    boot/delete operations using the handle_port
    delete_port extension interface messages
    and update the hypervisor's FDB table accordingly.

    Please note this L2 agent extension doesn't support
    allowed address pairs extension.
