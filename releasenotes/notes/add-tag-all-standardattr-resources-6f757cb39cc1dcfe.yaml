features:
  - The resource tag mechanism is refactored so that the tag support
    for new resources can be supported easily.
    The resources with tag support are network, subnet, port, subnetpool,
    trunk, floatingip, policy, security_group, and router.
deprecations:
  - Users can use 'tagging' extension instead of the 'tag' extension and
    'tag-ext' extension. Those extensions are now deprecated and will be
    removed in the Queens release.
