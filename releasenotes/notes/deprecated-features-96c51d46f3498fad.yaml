    During Liberty, some Neutron APIs and options were deprecated. This included
    the FWaaS API, the LBaaS V1 API, and the 'external_network_bridge' option
    for the L3 agent.
other:
  - The FWaaS API is marked as experimental for Liberty. Further, the current
    API will be removed in Mitaka and replaced with a new FWaaS API, which the
    team is in the process of developing.
  - The LBaaS V1 API is marked as deprecated and is planned to be removed in
    a future release. Going forward, the LBaaS V2 API should be used.
  - The 'external_network_bridge' option for the L3 agent has been deprecated
    in favor of a bridge_mapping with a physnet. For more information, see the
    `Network Node <http://docs.openstack.org/networking-guide/scenario_legacy_ovs.html>`_
     section of this scenario in the networking guide.
