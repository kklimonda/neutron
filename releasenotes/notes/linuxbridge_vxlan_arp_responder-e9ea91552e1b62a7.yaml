upgrade:
  - When using ML2 and the Linux Bridge agent, the default value for the ARP
    Responder under L2Population has changed. The responder is now disabled to
    improve compatibility with the allowed-address-pair extension and to match
    the default behavior of the ML2 OVS agent. The logical network will now
    utilize traditional flood and learn through the overlay. When upgrading,
    existing vxlan devices will retain their old setup and be unimpacted by
    changes to this flag. To apply this to older devices created with the
    Liberty agent, the vxlan device must be removed and then the Mitaka agent
    restarted. The agent will recreate the vxlan devices with the current
    settings upon restart. To maintain pre-Mitaka behavior, enable the
    arp_responder in the Linux Bridge agent VXLAN config file prior to starting
    the updated agent.
fixes:
  - The Linuxbridge agent now supports the ability to toggle the local ARP
    responder when L2Population is enabled. This ensures compatibility with
    the allowed-address-pairs extension.
    closes bug 1445089
