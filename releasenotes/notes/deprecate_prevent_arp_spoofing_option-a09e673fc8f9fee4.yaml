deprecations:
  - The option ``[AGENT] prevent_arp_spoofing`` has been deprecated
    and will be removed in Ocata release. ARP spoofing protection
    should always be enabled unless its explicitly disabled via the
    port security extension via the API. The primary reason it was
    a config option was because it was merged at the end of Kilo
    development cycle so it was not considered stable. It has been
    enabled by default since Liberty and is considered stable
    and there is no reason to keep this configurable.
