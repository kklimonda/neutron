    An OVS agent configured to run in DVR mode will fail to start if it
    cannot get proper DVR configuration values from the server on start-up.
    The agent will no longer fallback to non-DVR mode, since it may lead to
    inconsistency in the DVR-enabled cluster as the Neutron server does not
    distinguish between DVR and non-DVR OVS agents.
