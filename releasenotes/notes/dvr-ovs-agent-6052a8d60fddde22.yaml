    An OVS agent configured to run in DVR mode will fail in case it can't get
    proper DVR configs from server on start. Such agent will no longer fallback
    to non-DVR mode since it may lead to inconsistency in the DVR enabled
    cluster as Neutron server does not really distinguish DVR and non-DVR OVS
    agents.
