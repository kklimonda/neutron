    The Neutron API now supports conditional updates to resources with the
    'revision_number' attribute by setting the desired revision number in
    an HTTP If-Match header. This allows clients to ensure that a resource
    hasn't been modified since it was retrieved by the client. Support for
    conditional updates on the server can be checked for by looking for the
    'revision-if-match' extension in the supported extensions.
