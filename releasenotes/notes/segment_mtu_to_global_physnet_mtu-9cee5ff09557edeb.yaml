deprecations:
  - The 'segment_mtu' option of the ML2 configuration has been
    deprecated and replaced with the 'global_physnet_mtu' option
    in the main Neutron configuration. This option is meant to
    be used by all plugins for an operator to reference their
    physical network's MTU, regardless of the backend plugin.
    Plugins should access this config option via the
    'get_deployment_physnet_mtu' method added to
    neutron.plugins.common.utils to avoid being broken on any
    potential renames in the future.
