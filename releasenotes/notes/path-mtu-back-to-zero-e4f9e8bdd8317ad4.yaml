upgrade:
  - In case you rely on the default ML2 path_mtu value of 1500 to cap MTU used
    for new network resources, please set it explicitly in your ml2_conf.ini
    file.
fixes:
  - The default value for ML2 path_mtu option is changed from 1500 to 0,
    effectively disabling its participation in network MTU calculation unless
    it's overridden in the ml2_conf.ini configuration file.
