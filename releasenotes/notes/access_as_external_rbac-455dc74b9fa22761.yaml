  - External networks can now be controlled using the
    RBAC framework that was added in Liberty. This allows
    networks to be made available to specific tenants
    (as opposed to all tenants) to be used as an external
    gateway for routers and floating IPs.
    By default this feature will also allow regular tenants
    to make their networks available as external networks
    to other individual tenants (or even themselves), but
    they are prevented from using the wildcard to share to
    all tenants. This behavior can be adjusted via
    policy.json by the operator if desired.
