fixes:
  - Prior to Mitaka, neither specifying DNS resolvers via the
    'dnsmasq_dns_servers' option in the DHCP agent configuration file nor via
    neutron subnet options causes the dnsmasq service to offer the IP address
    on which it resides to instances for name resolution. However, the static
    dnsmasq '--no-resolv' process argument prevents name resolution via dnsmasq
    leaving instances without name resolution. In Mitaka+, the
    'dnsmasq_local_resolv' option in the DHCP agent configuration file enables
    (by default) the dnsmasq service to provide name resolution for instances
    via DNS resolvers on the host running the DHCP agent by effectively
    removing the '--no-resolv' option from the dnsmasq process arguments.
    Adding custom DNS resolvers to the 'dnsmasq_dns_servers' option in the DHCP
    agent configuration file disables this feature.
