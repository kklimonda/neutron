fixes:
  - Prior to Mitaka, name resolution in instances requires specifying DNS
    resolvers via the 'dnsmasq_dns_servers' option in the DHCP agent
    configuration file or via neutron subnet options. In this case, the
    data plane must provide connectivity between instances and upstream DNS
    resolvers. Omitting both of these methods causes the dnsmasq service
    to offer the IP address on which it resides to instances for name
    resolution. However, the static dnsmasq '--no-resolv' process argument
    prevents name resolution via dnsmasq, leaving instances without name
    resolution.
    Mitaka introduces the 'dnsmasq_local_resolv' option, default value False
    to preserve backward-compatibility, that enables the dnsmasq service to
    provide name resolution for instances via DNS resolvers on the host
    running the DHCP agent. In this case, the data plane must provide
    connectivity between the host and upstream DNS resolvers rather than
    between the instances and upstream DNS resolvers. Specifying DNS
    resolvers via the 'dnsmasq_dns_servers' option in the DHCP agent
    configuration overrides the 'dnsmasq_local_resolv' option for all subnets
    using the DHCP agent.
