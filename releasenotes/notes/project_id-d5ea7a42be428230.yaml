  - The Networking API now supports the 'project_id' field in requests and
    responses, for compatibility with the Identity (Keystone) API V3. A new
    API extension, 'project-id', has been added to allow API users to detect
    if the 'project_id' field is supported. Note that the 'tenant_id' field
    is still supported, and the two fields are functionally equivalent.
