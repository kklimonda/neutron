fixes:
  - A special case has been added to allow the creation of DHCP ports
    on Service Subnets that do not have the service type "network:dhcp",
    provided that the subnet has 'enable_dhcp' set to 'True'.
    This fixes the recurring error seen when neutron attempts to
    automatically create a DHCP port on a dhcp-enabled subnet after the
    subnet is created. See bug report
    `1636963 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1636963>`_ for
    more details.
