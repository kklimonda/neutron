features:
  - Proactively create DVR floating IP namespace on all compute nodes
    when a gateway is configured.
issues:
  - Creating DVR floating IP namespace on all nodes proactively
    might consume public IP Address, but by using
    subnet service-types as explained in `the networking guide
    <https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/admin/config-service-subnets.html>`__
    consumers can use the private IPs for floating IP agent gateway ports
    and need not consume any public IP addresses.
