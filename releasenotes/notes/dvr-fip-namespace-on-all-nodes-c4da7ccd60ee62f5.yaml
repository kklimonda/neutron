    Add DVR Floating IP (FIP) Namespace creation event
    on all nodes, based on the gateway configuration.
features:
  - Proactively create Floating IP Namespace on all compute nodes
    when a gateway is configured.
issues:
  - This might consume public IP Address, but by using
    subnet service-types as explained in the docs below
    https://docs.openstack.org/networking-guide/config-service-subnets.html
    consumers can use the private IPs for floating IP agent gateway ports
    and need not consume any public IP addresses.
