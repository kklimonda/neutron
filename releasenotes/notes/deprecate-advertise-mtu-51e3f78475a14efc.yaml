deprecations:
  - The 'advertise_mtu' option is deprecated and will be removed in Ocata.
    There should be no use case to disable the feature, hence the option is
    considered redundant. DHCP and L3 agents will continue advertising MTU
    values to instances. Other plugins not using those agents are also
    encouraged to advertise MTU to instances. The actual implementation of MTU
    advertisement depends on the plugin in use, but it's assumed that at least
    DHCP option for IPv4 clients and Router Advertisements for IPv6 clients is
    supported.
