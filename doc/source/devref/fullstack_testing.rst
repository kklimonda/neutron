      Convention for heading levels in Neutron devref:
      =======  Heading 0 (reserved for the title in a document)
      -------  Heading 1
      ~~~~~~~  Heading 2
      +++++++  Heading 3
      '''''''  Heading 4
      (Avoid deeper levels because they do not render well.)


Full Stack Testing
==================

Goals
-----

* Stabilize the job:
    - Fix L3 HA failure
    - Look in to non-deterministic failures when adding a large amount of
      tests (Possibly bug 1486199).
    - Switch to kill signal 15 to terminate neutron-server & agents (Bugs
      1487548 and 1494363).
* Convert the L3 HA failover functional test to a full stack test
* Write a test for DHCP HA / Multiple DHCP agents per network
* Write DVR tests
* Write additional L3 HA tests
* Write a test that validates DVR + L3 HA integration after
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1365473 is fixed.
