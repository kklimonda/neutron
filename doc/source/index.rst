Welcome to Neutron's documentation!
===================================

Neutron is an OpenStack project to provide "network connectivity as a service"
between interface devices (e.g., vNICs) managed by other OpenStack services
(e.g., nova). It implements the `Neutron API`_.

.. _`Neutron API`: https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/networking/

This documentation is generated by the Sphinx toolkit and lives in the source
tree.  Additional documentation on Neutron and other components of OpenStack
can be found on the `OpenStack wiki`_ and the `Neutron section of the wiki`.
The `Neutron Development wiki`_ is also a good resource for new contributors.
