Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Modular Layer 2 (ML2) neutron plug-in is a framework allowing OpenStack
Networking to simultaneously use the variety of layer 2 networking
technologies found in complex real-world data centers. The ML2 framework
distinguishes between the two kinds of drivers that can be configured:

* Type drivers

  Define how an OpenStack network is technically realized. Example: VXLAN

  Each available network type is managed by an ML2 type driver. Type drivers
  maintain any needed type-specific network state. They validate the type
  specific information for provider networks and are responsible for the
  allocation of a free segment in project networks.

* Mechanism drivers

  Define the mechanism to access an OpenStack network of a certain type.
  Example: Open vSwitch mechanism driver.

  The mechanism driver is responsible for taking the information established by
  the type driver and ensuring that it is properly applied given the
  specific networking mechanisms that have been enabled.

  Mechanism drivers can utilize L2 agents (via RPC) and/or interact directly
  with external devices or controllers.

Multiple mechanism and type drivers can be used simultaneously to access
different ports of the same virtual network.

.. note::

   L2 population is a special mechanism driver that optimizes BUM (Broadcast,
   unknown destination address, multicast) traffic in the overlay networks
   VXLAN and GRE. It needs to be used in conjunction with either the
   Linux bridge or the Open vSwitch mechanism driver and cannot be used as
   standalone mechanism driver. For more information, see the
   *Mechanism drivers* section below.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Network type drivers
--------------------

To enable type drivers in the ML2 plug-in. Edit the
``/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini`` file:

.. code-block:: ini

    [ml2]
    type_drivers = flat,vlan,vxlan,gre

.. note::

   For more detailsï¼Œsee the `Bug 1567792 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-manuals/+bug/1567792>`__.

For more details, see the
`Networking configuration options <https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/config-reference/networking/networking_options_reference.html#modular-layer-2-ml2-plug-in-configuration-options>`__
of Configuration Reference.

The following type drivers are available

* Flat

* VLAN

* GRE

* VXLAN

Provider network types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Provider networks provide connectivity like project networks.
But only administrative (privileged) users can manage those
networks because they interface with the physical network infrastructure.
More information about provider networks see
:doc:`intro-os-networking` or the `OpenStack Administrator Guide
<https://docs.openstack.org/admin-guide/networking-adv-features.html#provider-networks>`__.

* Flat

  The administrator needs to configure a list of physical network names that
  can be used for provider networks.
  For more details, see the related section in the
  `Configuration Reference <https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/config-reference/networking/networking_options_reference.html#modular-layer-2-ml2-flat-type-configuration-options>`__.

* VLAN

  The administrator needs to configure a list of physical network names that
  can be used for provider networks.
  For more details, see the related section in the
  `Configuration Reference <https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/config-reference/networking/networking_options_reference.html#modular-layer-2-ml2-vlan-type-configuration-options>`__.

* GRE

  No additional configuration required.

* VXLAN

  The administrator can configure the VXLAN multicast group that should be
  used.

  .. note::

     VXLAN multicast group configuration is not applicable for the Open
     vSwitch agent.

     As of today it is not used in the Linux bridge agent. The Linux bridge
     agent has its own agent specific configuration option. For more details,
     see the `Bug 1523614 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1523614>`__.

Project network types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Project networks provide connectivity to instances for a particular
project. Regular (non-privileged) users can manage project networks
within the allocation that an administrator or operator defines for
them. More information about project and provider networks see
:doc:`intro-os-networking`
or the `OpenStack Administrator Guide
<https://docs.openstack.org/admin-guide/networking-adv-features.html#provider-networks>`__.

Project network configurations are made in the
``/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini`` configuration file on the neutron
server:

* VLAN

  The administrator needs to configure the range of VLAN IDs that can be
  used for project network allocation.
  For more details, see the related section in the
  `Configuration Reference <https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/config-reference/networking/networking_options_reference.html#modular-layer-2-ml2-vlan-type-configuration-options>`__.

* GRE

  The administrator needs to configure the range of tunnel IDs that can be
  used for project network allocation.
  For more details, see the related section in the
  `Configuration Reference <https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/config-reference/networking/networking_options_reference.html#modular-layer-2-ml2-gre-type-configuration-options>`__.

* VXLAN

  The administrator needs to configure the range of VXLAN IDs that can be
  used for project network allocation.
  For more details, see the related section in the
  `Configuration Reference <https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/config-reference/networking/networking_options_reference.html#modular-layer-2-ml2-vxlan-type-configuration-options>`__.

.. note::
   Flat networks for project allocation are not supported. They only
   can exist as a provider network.

.. note::
   L2 population is not listed here, as it is not a standalone mechanism.
   If other agents are supported depends on the conjunctive mechanism driver
   that is used for binding a port.

   `OpenStack Manuals <http://docs.ocselected.org/openstack-manuals/kilo/networking-guide/content/ml2_l2pop_scenarios.html>`__.


Buying guide
------------

This guide characterizes the L2 reference implementations that currently exist.

* Open vSwitch mechanism and Open vSwitch agent

  Can be used for instance network attachments as well as for attachments of
  other network resources like routers, DHCP, and so on.

* Linux bridge mechanism and Linux bridge agent

  Can be used for instance network attachments as well as for attachments of
  other network resources like routers, DHCP, and so on.

* SRIOV mechanism driver and SRIOV NIC switch agent

  Can only be used for instance network attachments (device_owner = compute).

  Is deployed besides an other mechanism driver and L2 agent such as OVS or
  Linux bridge. It offers instances direct access to the network adapter
  through a PCI Virtual Function (VF). This gives an instance direct access to
  hardware capabilities and high performance networking.

  The cloud consumer can decide via the neutron APIs VNIC_TYPE attribute, if
  an instance gets a normal OVS port or an SRIOV port.

  Due to direct connection, some features are not available when using SRIOV.
  For example, DVR, security groups, migration.

  For more information see the :ref:`config-sriov`.

* MacVTap mechanism driver and MacVTap agent

  Can only be used for instance network attachments (device_owner = compute)
  and not for attachment of other resources like routers, DHCP, and so on.

  It is positioned as alternative to Open vSwitch or Linux bridge support on
  the compute node for internal deployments.

  MacVTap offers a direct connection with very little overhead between
  instances and down to the adapter. You can use MacVTap agent on the
  compute node when you require a network connection that is performance
  critical. It does not require specific hardware (like with SRIOV).

  Due to the direct connection, some features are not available when using
  it on the compute node. For example, DVR, security groups and arp-spoofing
  protection.
