.. _migration-to-vrrp:

==============================
Add VRRP to an existing router
==============================

This section describes the process of migrating from a classic router to an L3
HA router, which is available starting from the Mitaka release.

Similar to the classic scenario, all network traffic on a project network that
requires routing actively traverses only one network node regardless of the
quantity of network nodes providing HA for the router. Therefore, this
high-availability implementation primarily addresses failure situations instead
of bandwidth constraints that limit performance. However, it supports random
distribution of routers on different network nodes to reduce the chances of
bandwidth constraints and to improve scaling.

This section references parts of :ref:`deploy-lb-ha-vrrp` and
:ref:`deploy-ovs-ha-vrrp`. For details regarding needed infrastructure and
configuration to allow actual L3 HA deployment, read the relevant guide
before continuing with the migration process.

Migration
~~~~~~~~~

The migration process is quite simple, it involves turning down the router by
setting the router's ``admin_state_up`` attribute to ``False``, upgrading the
router to L3 HA and then setting the router's ``admin_state_up`` attribute back
to ``True``.

.. warning::

   Once starting the migration, south-north connections (instances to internet)
   will be severed. New connections will be able to start only when the
   migration is complete.

Here is the router we have used in our demonstration:

L3 HA to Legacy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To return to classic mode, turn down the router again, turning off L3 HA
and starting the router again.

   Once starting the migration, south-north connections (instances to internet)
   will be severed. New connections will be able to start only when the
   migration is complete.
