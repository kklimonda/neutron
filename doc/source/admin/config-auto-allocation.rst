.. _config-auto-allocation:

==========================================
Automatic allocation of network topologies
==========================================

The auto-allocation feature introduced in Mitaka simplifies the procedure of
setting up an external connectivity for end-users, and is also known as **Get
Me A Network**.

Previously, a user had to configure a range of networking resources to boot
a server and get access to the Internet. For example, the following steps
are required:

* Create a network
* Create a subnet
* Create a router
* Uplink the router on an external network
* Downlink the router on the previously created subnet

These steps need to be performed on each logical segment that a VM needs to
be connected to, and may require networking knowledge the user might not
have.

This feature is designed to automate the basic networking provisioning for
projects. The steps to provision a basic network are run during instance
boot, making the networking setup hands-free.

To make this possible, provide a default external network and default
subnetpools (one for IPv4, or one for IPv6, or one of each) so that the
Networking service can choose what to do in lieu of input. Once these are in
place, users can boot their VMs without specifying any networking details.
The Compute service will then use this feature automatically to wire user
VMs.

Enabling the deployment for auto-allocation
-------------------------------------------

To use this feature, the neutron service must have the following extensions
enabled:

* ``auto-allocated-topology``
* ``subnet_allocation``
* ``external-net``
* ``router``

Before the end-user can use the auto-allocation feature, the operator must
create the resources that will be used for the auto-allocated network
topology creation. To perform this task, proceed with the following steps:

#. Set up a default external network

   Setting up an external network is described in
   `OpenStack Administrator Guide
   <https://docs.openstack.org/admin-guide/networking-adv-features.html>`_.
   Assuming the external network to be used for the auto-allocation feature
   is named ``public``, make it the ``default`` external network
   with the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ openstack network set public --default

   .. note::

      The flag ``--default`` (and ``--no-default`` flag) is only effective
      with external networks and has no effects on regular (or internal)
      networks.

#. Create default subnetpools

   The auto-allocation feature requires at least one default
   subnetpool. One for IPv4, or one for IPv6, or one of each.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ openstack subnet pool create --share --default \
        --pool-prefix 192.0.2.0/24 --default-prefix-length 26 \
        shared-default

Get Me A Network
----------------

In a deployment where the operator has set up the resources as described above,
they can get their auto-allocated network topology as follows:

.. code-block:: console

   $ openstack network auto allocated topology create --or-show
   +------------+--------------------------------------+
   | Field      | Value                                |
   +------------+--------------------------------------+
   | id         | a380c780-d6cd-4510-a4c0-1a6ec9b85a29 |
   | name       | None                                 |
   | project_id | cfd1889ac7d64ad891d4f20aef9f8d7c     |
   +------------+--------------------------------------+

.. note::

    When the ``--or-show`` option is used the command returns the topology
    information if it already exists.

Operators (and users with admin role) can get the auto-allocated topology for a
project by specifying the project ID:

.. code-block:: console

   $ openstack network auto allocated topology create --project \
     cfd1889ac7d64ad891d4f20aef9f8d7c --or-show
   +------------+--------------------------------------+
   | Field      | Value                                |
   +------------+--------------------------------------+
   | id         | a380c780-d6cd-4510-a4c0-1a6ec9b85a29 |
   | name       | None                                 |
   | project_id | cfd1889ac7d64ad891d4f20aef9f8d7c     |
   +------------+--------------------------------------+

The ID returned by this command is a network which can be used for booting
a VM.

.. code-block:: console

   $ openstack server create --flavor m1.small --image \
     cirros-0.3.5-x86_64-uec --nic \
     net-id=8b835bfb-cae2-4acc-b53f-c16bb5f9a7d0 vm1

The auto-allocated topology for a user never changes. In practice, when a user
boots a server omitting the ``--nic`` option, and there is more than one
network available, the Compute service will invoke the API behind
``auto allocated topology create``, fetch the network UUID, and pass it on
during the boot process.

Validating the requirements for auto-allocation
-----------------------------------------------

To validate that the required resources are correctly set up for
auto-allocation, without actually provisioning anything, use
the ``--check-resources`` option:

.. code-block:: console

   $ openstack network auto allocated topology create --check-resources
   Deployment error: No default router:external network.

   $ openstack network set public --default

   $ openstack network auto allocated topology create --check-resources
   Deployment error: No default subnetpools defined.

   $ openstack subnet pool set shared-default --default

   $ openstack network auto allocated topology create --check-resources
   +---------+-------+
   | Field   | Value |
   +---------+-------+
   | dry-run | pass  |
   +---------+-------+

The validation option behaves identically for all users. However, it
is considered primarily an admin or service utility since it is the
operator who must set up the requirements.

Project resources created by auto-allocation
--------------------------------------------

The auto-allocation feature creates one network topology in every project
where it is used. The auto-allocated network topology for a project contains
the following resources:

+--------------------+------------------------------+
|Resource            |Name                          |
+====================+==============================+
|network             |``auto_allocated_network``    |
+--------------------+------------------------------+
|subnet (IPv4)       |``auto_allocated_subnet_v4``  |
+--------------------+------------------------------+
|subnet (IPv6)       |``auto_allocated_subnet_v6``  |
+--------------------+------------------------------+
|router              |``auto_allocated_router``     |
+--------------------+------------------------------+

Compatibility notes
-------------------

Nova uses the ``auto allocated topology`` feature with API micro
version 2.37 or later. This is because, unlike the neutron feature
which was implemented in the Mitaka release, the integration for
nova was completed during the Newton release cycle. Note that
the CLI option ``--nic`` can be omitted regardless of the microversion
used as long as there is no more than one network available to the
project, in which case nova fails with a 400 error because it
does not know which network to use. Furthermore, nova does not start
using the feature, regardless of whether or not a user requests
micro version 2.37 or later, unless all of the ``nova-compute``
services are running Newton-level code.
