Host networking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After installing the operating system on each node for the architecture
that you choose to deploy, you must configure the network interfaces. We
recommend that you disable any automated network management tools and
manually edit the appropriate configuration files for your distribution.
For more information on how to configure networking on your
distribution, see the `documentation <https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/network-configuration.html>`_.

All nodes require Internet access for administrative purposes such as package
installation, security updates, Domain Name System (DNS), and
Network Time Protocol (NTP). In most cases, nodes should obtain
Internet access through the management network interface.
To highlight the importance of network separation, the example architectures
use `private address space <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918>`__ for the
management network and assume that the physical network infrastructure
provides Internet access via Network Address Translation (NAT)
or other methods. The example architectures use routable IP address space for
the provider (external) network and assume that the physical network
infrastructure provides direct Internet access.

In the provider networks architecture, all instances attach directly
to the provider network. In the self-service (private) networks architecture,
instances can attach to a self-service or provider network. Self-service
networks can reside entirely within OpenStack or provide some level of external
network access using Network Address Translation (NAT) through
the provider network.

The example architectures assume use of the following networks:

* Management on 10.0.0.0/24 with gateway 10.0.0.1

  This network requires a gateway to provide Internet access to all
  nodes for administrative purposes such as package installation,
  security updates, Domain Name System (DNS), and
  Network Time Protocol (NTP).

* Provider on 203.0.113.0/24 with gateway 203.0.113.1

  This network requires a gateway to provide Internet access to
  instances in your OpenStack environment.

You can modify these ranges and gateways to work with your particular
network infrastructure.

Network interface names vary by distribution. Traditionally,
interfaces use ``eth`` followed by a sequential number. To cover all
variations, this guide refers to the first interface as the
interface with the lowest number and the second interface as the
interface with the highest number.

Unless you intend to use the exact configuration provided in this
example architecture, you must modify the networks in this procedure to
match your environment. Each node must resolve the other nodes by
name in addition to IP address. For example, the ``controller`` name must
resolve to ``10.0.0.11``, the IP address of the management interface on
the controller node.

.. warning::

   Reconfiguring network interfaces will interrupt network
   connectivity. We recommend using a local terminal session for these
   procedures.

.. note::

   Your distribution does not enable a restrictive firewall by
   default. For more information about securing your environment,
   refer to the `OpenStack Security Guide
   <https://docs.openstack.org/security-guide/>`_.
