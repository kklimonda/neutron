Neutron PTL Office Hours
------------------------

Neutron has evolved into a platform. As part of the broader `Big Tent <http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/openstack-as-layers-but-also-a-big-tent-but-also-a-bunch-of-cats>`_ initiative, Neutron has also opened it's doors to the Neutron "Stadium"
effort.

This, combined with the new `Lieutenant System <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/neutron/policies/core-reviewers.html#core-review-hierarchy>`_
means the PTL is now responsible for leading an increasingly large and
diverse group of contributors. To ensure weekly syncs between the PTL and
the Lieutenants, as well as to allow for projects under the Neutron Stadium
to have a sync point with the PTL, the project is setting up office hours
in the #openstack-neutron-release IRC channel. The PTL will use these
office hours to allow for questions and syncing with Lieutenants or anyone
else .

The current office hours can be seen on the `OpenStack eavesdrop page <http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/#Neutron_PTL_Office_Hours>`_.
Please note the #openstack-neutron-release channel is logged to allow the
consumption of these discussion by those who cannot make the times above.
